# Breast Cancer Detection Project 
Breast cancer detection is a final project for my course from [general assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online) and using a dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). The main goal for this project is to analyze the dataset and to predict the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign). The project is supervised by [James Larkin](https://github.com/Larkin22) and [Ahmed Alrasheed](https://github.com/AlrasheedA).
